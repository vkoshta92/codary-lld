/*
Encapsulation says 2 things:
1. An Object's Characteristics and its behaviour are encapsulated together
within that Object.
2. All the characteristics or behaviours are not for everyone to access.
Object should provide data security.

We follow above 2 pointers about Object of real world in programming by:
1. Creating a class that act as a blueprint for Object creation. Class contain
all the characteristics (class variable) and behaviour (class methods) in one block,
encapsulating it together.
2. We introduce access modifiers (public, private, protected) etc to provide data
security to the class members.
